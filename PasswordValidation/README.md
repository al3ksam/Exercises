## Password Validation
You're interviewing to join a security team. They want to see you build a password evaluator for your technical interview to validate the input.
<br>

**Task**<br>
Write a program that takes in a string as input and evaluates it as a valid password. 
The password is valid if it has at a minimum **2 numbers**, 
**2** of the following **special characters** ('!', '@', '#', '$', '%', '&', '*'), and a **length** of at least **7** characters.
If the password passes the check, output 'Strong', else output 'Weak'.
<br>

**Input Format**<br>
A string representing the password to evaluate.
<br>

**Output Format**<br>
A string that says 'Strong' if the input meets the requirements, or 'Weak', if not.
<br>

**Sample Input**<br>
Hello@$World19
<br>

**Sample Output**<br>
Strong
